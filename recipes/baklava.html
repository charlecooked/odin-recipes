        <h2>Deliciously Delectable Baklava</h2>
            <p>I grew up near a volcano and it was both dangerous and exhilarating. 
                I would often spend my afternoons as a little boy with my grandmother, 
                who I endearingly call ‘Bak’. Whenever the volcano would spit up and 
                start to flow I would shout and point ‘Bak, lava!’ </p>
            <p><strong>Prep time:</strong> 1.5 hours
                <strong>Total time:</strong> 1.5 hours plus 1 hour chilling in the fridge
                <strong>Cook time:</strong> 45 minutes 
                <strong>Yield:</strong> makes 40 portions </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h4>Syrup mixture</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 cups honey</li>
                <li>2 cups waters</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>2 lemons sliced into thick rounds (discard the ends)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Body</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Filo pastry</li>
                <li>6-7 cups crushed walnuts</li>
                <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 tbsp granulated sugard</li>
                <li>750g butter</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the syrup mixture. Mix the sugar with the honey and 
                    the water in a pot and bring to a simmer over a hob. You basically 
                    want everything to dissolve nicely (you’re not trying to cook anything 
                    here).</li>
                <li>Once everything is dissolved, turn off the heat and put the pot aside. 
                    Put the cinnamon stick and lemon slices in the pot, and then put the 
                    lid on the pot.</li>
                <li>Let the pot cool to room temperature (during this time it is steeping 
                    like tea).</li>
                <li>In another pot place 500g of butter and melt it over low heat. </li>
                <li>Next move on to the base. Grab a 1 x 1/1 80mm pan and baste the bottom 
                    and sides generously with the melted butter. </li>
                <li>Place in your first layer of filo pastry (you will need to cut the filo 
                    at each layer to fit).</li>
                <li>Repeat this process 6 times (i.e baste the first layer of filo pastry 
                    generously! with butter and then put the second layer down and repeat). 
                    You will have a total of 6 layers of filo pastry.</li>
                <li>Take your walnuts, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tbsp of sugar. Mix these 
                    ingredients together in a bowl. </li>
                <li>Butter your 6th layer of filo and put down a third of your walnut mixture. 
                    Spread the mixture out evenly. </li>
                <li>Place a layer of filo pastry directly on top of the nuts (no need for 
                    butter here).</li>
                <li>Repeat two more times with butter until you have a total of 3 filo pastry 
                    layers. </li>
                <li>Butter the third layer and spread down another ⅓ of your walnut mixture. </li>
                <li>Place down another three filo pastry layers with butter.</li>
                <li>Spread out the last of your walnut mixture.</li>
                <li>Now here you are going to do 6 final layers of filo pastry like you did 
                    at the beginning. Your equation should be like this: 6 layers + nuts +
                    3 layers + nuts + 3 layers + nuts + 6 layers = correct. </li>
                <li>Brush the last layer of filo pastry liberally with butter like you have 
                    done so many times now. </li>
                <li>Place this baklava pan in the fridge to set for 1 hour so that you can cut it. </li>
                <li>Just before the baklava is set, preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius 
                    (or 150 on our oven). </li>
                <li>Pull the baklava tray out of the fridge and cut the baklava into 40 portions. 
                    Work quickly. It should be 5 wide by 8 long. As long as the butter is cold 
                    and set it should be relatively easy to cut.</li>
                <li>Put the tray directly in the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until nice and browned. </li>
                <li>When finished pull the tray from the oven and immediately pour the syrup 
                    mixture (without the lemons or cinnamon stick) all over the baklava and in 
                    all the cracks. It will sizzle delightfully. </li>
                <li>Let the baklava now cool to room temperature before serving. It will soak up
                     all the juices that you poured in (it might seem like a lot of liquid at 
                     first when you first add the syrup mixture). </li>
                <li>The baklava should last nicely for 5 days covered out of the fridge. </li>
                <li>Serve on top of yaourt chantilly with some crushed walnuts.</li>
            </ol>
