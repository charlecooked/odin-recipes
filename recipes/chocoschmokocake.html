        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For Body</h4>
        <h5>DRY</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups or 590g flour</li>
                <li>3.5 cups or 710g granulated sugar (sucre fine)</li>
                <li>2 x 11g packets levure chimique</li>
                <li>.75 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>3.5 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1.5 cups or 190g cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>WET</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>2.25 cups or 562.5ml vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 cups or 750ml warm (bare simmer) milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>For Top</h4>
        <h5>GANACHE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>350g choc chips</li>
                <li>1.5 cups or 375ml creme liquide</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>OTHER PART</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>350g cream cheese</li>
                <li>.75 cup powdered sugar</li>
                <li>Scant 3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>.75 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the ganache. In a double boiler (i.e our glass bowl over a just 
                    simmering pot of water) use a spatula to combine the chocolate chips 
                    with the creme liquide. Once smooth, put aside to cool. You want this 
                    to be at room temperature when you make the topping. So don’t let it 
                    cool too much (caution in winter) otherwise you’ll need to heat it 
                    up a little bit for it to be workable.</li>
                <li>Take our three pop-out cake tins. Use a paper towel to wipe them with 
                    vegetable oil. Trace pieces of baking paper for each, cut the circles 
                    out and press and smooth into the bottom of the tins. Wipe the bottom 
                    surface and the sides down with vegetable oil. Put each tin in a tray 
                    to go in the oven. I didn’t use to put them in trays and one time I 
                    cooked cake batter into the oven fan engine. Not FUN.</li>
                <li>Whisk flour, sugar, levure chimique, baking powder and salt (3.5 tsp) 
                    together in one of our large metal bowls (because they are the biggest 
                    bowls and you’ll need the room later when you add the rest of the ingredients).</li>
                <li>Sift the cocoa powder into the mixed dry ingredients and whisk until combined.</li>
                <li>Put the milk (3 cups) in a small pot on a low burner. Bring this up to 
                    a bare simmer while you prepare the rest of the mixture. BE careful 
                    that you don’t boil the milk. You boil the milk, you're gonna have a bad time.</li>
                <li>Turn the oven on to 120 degrees celsius (120 on our oven, 150 IRL).</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl whisk the WET ingredients (eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla extract) 
                    for 30 seconds to 1 minute until well combined and creamy.</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to combine the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. 
                    Spatch it together. It will be thick and pasty and that’s okay.</li>
                <li>Once the milk comes to a bare simmer, pour it into the pasty mixture 
                    and whisk until just combined. Don’t overmix.</li>
                <li>Immediately pour the cake batter into the three tins. Tap each tin a few times 
                    to remove the bubbles and put directly into the oven at 120 degrees celsius 
                    for about 30 minutes, maybe a little more, just until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Once a toothpick comes out clean (one or two of the cakes might need longer) pull the 
                    cakes out and let them cool to room temperature on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Make the topping. In a bowl, whisk with the electrified hand mixer, the OTHER PART 
                    (cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract and salt). Once smooth, electric mix 
                    in the cooled chocolate ganache from before. DON’T overmix this part, it will be hard 
                    to use and you won’t be able to get nice peaks on the cake.</li>
                <li>When the cake bases are cooled, carefully take the cakes out of the pans (you'll need 
                    to run a knife around and under) and lift them with a large spatula onto the plastic cake containers.</li>
                <li>Spatch ⅓ of the topping on each cake. With a spoon spread the topping around and ‘wave it up’. 
                    A technique that you will need to see Charles Caldow about.</li>
                <li>Place the plastic lid on the cake containers and date. Keep the cakes in the fridge for about 1 week.</li>
                <li>There are 12 portions in each cake. Serve as is, no need for nothing. Put a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.</li>
